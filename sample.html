	<h1>CSS and Web Design</h1>
	<p>CSS is the language of web design. If it wasn't for CSS, all web pages would look black and white and boring. But you can use CSS to make websites look beautiful.</p>

	<h2>Designing a website</h2>
	<p>How a website looks is just as important as what it does. If the font isn't readable, or the colours are too dark or too bright, the web site will be hard to use. If the information isn't laid out in a thoughtful way, it can be hard to tell where to look to find out what you want to know.</p>

	<p>But a well designed website can be a thing of beauty and fun to use. Famous sites like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a> employ expert web designers to design their websites. Those experts can be artists, font experts, programmers, and even psychologists, whose job it is to find out how people think when they're using the site and suggest ways to make the user's experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
	
	<p>There are lots of ways to plan how you want your web site to look. You might want to use a pencil and paper to draw out a rough draft. Then, you can use professional software to make a mockup of how you want the website to look when it's finished. Some people use programs like Adobe Dreamweaver to make the design process easier.</p>

	<h2>What can CSS do?</h2>
	<p>CSS can change lots of attributes of a web page. Here is a list of some of the things you can change, though there's lots more too:</p>

	<table class="attribute-table">
		<th>Selector</th>
		<th>Example Value</th>
		<th>What does it do?</th>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">color</td>
				<td>red</td>
				<td>Changes the colour of text.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">background-color</td>
				<td>blue</td>
				<td>Changes the background colour.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">background-image</td>
				<td>url("paper.gif");</td>
				<td>Sets one or more background images for an element.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">background-repeat</td>
				<td>repeat-y;</td>
				<td>Sets if/how a background image will be repeated.</td>
			</tr>

			</tr>
			<tr>

				<td>A feature that enables you to underline, overline selected text.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">text-align</td>
				<td>center;</td>
				<td>Allows the text to be shown on any side.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">text-shadow</td>
				<td>2px 2px #ff0000;</td>
				<td>Adds shadow to text.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">padding</td>
				<td>padding-top</td>
				<td>Used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">margin</td>
				<td>margin-top: 100px;</td>
				<td>Allows you to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">border</td>
				<td>ridge</td>
				<td>Adds any box around any selected text.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">border-radius</td>
				<td>25px;</td>
				<td>This feature allows you to add rounded borders to elements.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="attribute-name">box-shadow</td>
				<td>5px 3px black;</td>
				<td>Adds a shadow effect underneath boxes.</td>
			</tr>

	<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
	<p>How do people view web pages? They might use desktop computers, which have big screens which are landscape (wider than they are tall). Or they might use mobile phones, which have small screens and are usually held in portrait mode (taller than they are wide).</p>

	<p>This poses a problem for web designers, because they need to design websites which look good both on desktop and on mobile. But the requirements of each can be very different. For example, a desktop screen is big, so you can fit lots of text on one page. But a phohe screen is small, so you can fit less text in one view and then you'll have to scroll down to read the rest. Text on a mobile phone screen needs to be big enough to read.</p>

	<p>Mobile phone users will be using their touchscreens to navigate, unlike desktop users who will probably use a mouse. Fingers are bigger and clumsier than mice, so you need to make sure any buttons are big enough that the user can click them even if their fingers are really big!</p>

	<p>A website which takes all of these things and more into account is called <span class="keyword">responsive</span> because it will "respond" to changes in the size of the screen. Designing web pages with mobile and desktop users in mind is called <span class="keyword">responsive design.</span></p>

	<p>You can find out what your website will look like on mobile using Chrome's Developer Tools. Open up Developer Tools and click the Elements tab. In the top left corner there's a button with two rectangles called Toggle Device Toolbar. If you click it, Chrome will show you what your website looks like on a small screen, and you can even select a specific model of phone or tablet from the list!</p>

	<h2>Some Tips in Web Design</h2>
	<p>When you design a website, always think about the user. There's no point in making a website that has awesome pictures and insane fonts if it's impossible to read the text and you can't find the button you're looking for. So here are some top tips to bear in mind when you're building a website:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Colour your text well.</h3>
			<p>Don't put white text on a light background, or dark text on a black background, because it will be hard to read.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Choose your colour scheme wisely.</h3>
			<p>If you put too many bright colours together, it will make the user's eyes hurt! For example, red and blue together clash badly. But a darker shade of red (like darkred) and a lighter shade of blue (like turquoise) might look much nicer together.</p>
		</li>
		<li>	
			<h3>Keep your fonts sensible.</h3>
			<p>Some fonts are easy to read and others are not. For instance, <span class="silly-font">Jokerman ICT</span> looks fun, but you wouldn't want to read a whole book written in it! If you want to use a "fun" font in your website, stick it in the headings but use a more sensible font for the rest of the site so it's easier to read.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Serif or sans serif?</h3>
			<p>There are two main types of font: serif and sans-serif. Serifs are the little flicks on letters in older typefaces, so serif fonts are those which have serifs. Sans-serif means "without serifs", so that refers to fonts which don't.<br>
				Serif fonts will give your website an air of respectability, because serifs are usually seen in newspapers and books; you might see a serif font on an academic website. On the other hand, sans-serif fonts usually look more modern and cool, so choose those for websites which need to look more fresh.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Bear your audience in mind.</h3>
			<p>If your average user is going to be a young person, you can put lots of information on one screen. But if they are an old lady who isn't familiar with a computer, you need to space that information out so they don't get overwhelmed.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
