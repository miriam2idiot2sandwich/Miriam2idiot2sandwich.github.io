 <h1> About me</h1>
<p>My name is Miriam and I am 16 years old. I am currently attending Harris Academy St John's Wood.
I like to do a few hobbies and these include: Drawing, Reading, Listening to music and writing. 
I am currently doing my work experience at a technical company called Softwire. I have two older siblings which makes me the youngest. On my weekends or freetime, I like to browse the internet, catch up on homework/or coursework and sometimes read or write. </p>
